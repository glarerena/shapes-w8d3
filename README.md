This is the start of the readme for the assignment. 


Inside of the main program:
I created one instance of a circle, rectangele, and triangle. 
Then I made an empty array, iterated through it all, and displayed the results. 

To run this program, clone the shape repo to your local machine.
Make sure that you have Python installed.
Then go to your terminal and run python shapes.py
You will see the output of each instance I created with its data.
