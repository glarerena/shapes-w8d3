Now that we are creating our own repos on github, I am trying to remember to do a appendix on each assignment.
As a sort of refelction for myself, so I can go back review, and see my growth.
Also to share my experiences with the learning process.
I learned about constructor chaining, and used this with the classes, since I still feel uncomfortable using the superclass.

I did have to use ChatGPT to help me with the absbtractmethod, as we did not review this in class.
I am able to write the classes, attributes, and methods all without any help or references. 
I still need a better understanding of its hierachy of this whole assignment.
I understand the superclass, and children. Or the parent class and its children.
